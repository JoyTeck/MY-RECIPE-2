      <li>1 cup uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
      <li>1 Â½ cups water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>4 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li>1 cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>1 carrot, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>4 slices American processed cheese, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>4 slices cooked ham, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Step 1 </b>
        <p>
          Rinse rice in a strainer or colander until water runs clear. Combine
          rice with 1 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce
          heat to low; cover and simmer until rice is tender, 12 to 14 minutes.
          Spread cooked rice onto a baking sheet to cool. Season with 1
          tablespoon sesame oil and salt.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Step 2</b>
        <p>
          While rice is simmering, pour beaten eggs into a skillet over
          medium-high heat and allow to cook without stirring or turning to get
          a flat layer of cooked egg. When egg is completely cooked, remove from
          the skillet and set aside on a cutting board to cool.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Step 3</b>
        <p>
          Separate nori sheets onto a flat surface and divide cooled rice
          between them, leaving only a 1/2-inch strip seaweed visible at the top
          of each sheet. Arrange strips of egg, cucumber, carrot, cheese, and
          ham in thin layers over rice.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Step 4</b>
        <p>
          Beginning with the bottom of each sheet of nori, use a bamboo sushi
          mat to firmly roll each piece into a cylindrical shape. Brush each
          roll with 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil and cut into 6 equal pieces.
        </p>

    </ol>
